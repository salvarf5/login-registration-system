# Login-Registration-System
Secure Login System with PDO - OOP PHP 

# How it works
* The system is built 100% in PHP (some HTML, Javascript and JQuery knowledge is required).
* The visual framework used is Bootstrap.
* There are 4 main pages: index page shows login form and logged in panel, create user page shows a form to create a new user, forgot         password page shows a form to change password based on username, and profile page where you can change username and password once you 		logged in.

# Requirements
* PHP.
* Web Server (I personally use XAMPP).
* MySQL
* Bootstrap
* Javascript/JQuery.

# How to use it
* Simply download the source file to your computer.
* Import the file DB.sql into the current DBMS.
* Change database password and username if nedeed in the db.php file.
* Save the files, upload them to your webserver and give it try.
